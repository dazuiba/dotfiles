About

  Contains a set of dotfiles. There is an installation script to softlink them
  to the users home directory.

  Warning: Overwrites current dotfiles on installation!

How to install them?

  git clone git://github.com/janne/dotfiles.git
  cd dotfiles
  ./install.sh

  Have a look at templates, such as gitconfig.template, that are not installed.
